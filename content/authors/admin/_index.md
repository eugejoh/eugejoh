I am an epidemiologist with an interdisciplinary background and a strong interest in leveraging disparate data sources to solve public health problems. 

My main area of work is centered around infectious disease epidemiology, but I have parallel interests in reproducible workflows, open source tools, and the intersection of data science with public health research.
